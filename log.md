# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started new project called Compatibility App and installed Parse Dashboard (which took most of my time). 

**Thoughts:** It was my first time forking a repo AND creating a new repo on github. At the same time, I had a hard time installing Parse Dashboard as it is quite different from when I did it before. I also couldn't stay focused to this new app as I kept thinking about what I should do with my other app. I guess I really didn't code today so I will call it Day 0.

### Day 1: October 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Installed Parse Dashboard properly this time. Created a sign up form (only username) with some animations.

**Thoughts:** I really need to put on a timer while working. It seems like I worked more than an hour on this project. I also have to think about the design as well.

### Day 2: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked mostly on design and graphics. Was able to create a better signup page with some animations but still have to figure out how to pass data to and from view controllers. Getting a better grasp on PFQueries :)

**Thoughts:** Worked for 3 hours until XCode crashes. Good thing I used a timer this time.

### Day 3: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished signup and login view controllers. Learned how to call the camera and photo library. Also learned a little bit about gestures but can't really implement it in the app, maybe later? Also, created some graphics for the zodiac signs and learned how to use UIDatePicker.

**Thoughts:** Worked for more than 6 hours (stopped counting after 4 hours) since it's the weekend :)

### Day 4: October 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the settings page, which took me awhile to finish. I was able to make a function to crop the profile photo. Learned to use PFGeopoint to determin location. Also, removed any kind of error that may take place while signing up and logging in. Tomorrow I have to figure out how to fix the UIActivityIndicatorView while saving user info AND start with showing the matches. 

**Thoughts:** Worked again for more than 6 hours but there is a significant progress today :)

### Day 5: October 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Populated user list for more than 2 hours. Finished the main view controller with the compatibility calculator :)

**Thoughts:** Another significant progress today despite the distractions (ahem, netflix).

### Day 6: October 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Was able to somehow fix the UIView in the main controller after the gestures end. Also struggled a bit on creating  a text messenger within the app. 

**Thoughts:** Little progress today because I was distracted by depression.

### Day 7: October 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Done with the first view controller of the messaging part of this app. Only one more part left to code, which is the messenger and then I can polish the design and also add ads.

**Thoughts:** Once again, little progress because of distractions but little by little I'll get there.

### Day 8: October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messaging part of the app is working but not perfect! It looks weird but it already looks like a messenger anyway lol

**Thoughts:** I have to be extra patient with myself and think of a solution.
