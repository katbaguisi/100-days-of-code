# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started new project called Compatibility App and installed Parse Dashboard (which took most of my time). 

**Thoughts:** It was my first time forking a repo AND creating a new repo on github. At the same time, I had a hard time installing Parse Dashboard as it is quite different from when I did it before. I also couldn't stay focused to this new app as I kept thinking about what I should do with my other app. I guess I really didn't code today so I will call it Day 0.
