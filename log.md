# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started new project called Compatibility App and installed Parse Dashboard (which took most of my time). 

**Thoughts:** It was my first time forking a repo AND creating a new repo on github. At the same time, I had a hard time installing Parse Dashboard as it is quite different from when I did it before. I also couldn't stay focused to this new app as I kept thinking about what I should do with my other app. I guess I really didn't code today so I will call it Day 0.

### Day 1: October 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Installed Parse Dashboard properly this time. Created a sign up form (only username) with some animations.

**Thoughts:** I really need to put on a timer while working. It seems like I worked more than an hour on this project. I also have to think about the design as well.

### Day 2: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked mostly on design and graphics. Was able to create a better signup page with some animations but still have to figure out how to pass data to and from view controllers. Getting a better grasp on PFQueries :)

**Thoughts:** Worked for 3 hours until XCode crashes. Good thing I used a timer this time.
