# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started new project called Compatibility App and installed Parse Dashboard (which took most of my time). 

**Thoughts:** It was my first time forking a repo AND creating a new repo on github. At the same time, I had a hard time installing Parse Dashboard as it is quite different from when I did it before. I also couldn't stay focused to this new app as I kept thinking about what I should do with my other app. I guess I really didn't code today so I will call it Day 0.

### Day 1: October 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Installed Parse Dashboard properly this time. Created a sign up form (only username) with some animations.

**Thoughts:** I really need to put on a timer while working. It seems like I worked more than an hour on this project. I also have to think about the design as well.

### Day 2: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked mostly on design and graphics. Was able to create a better signup page with some animations but still have to figure out how to pass data to and from view controllers. Getting a better grasp on PFQueries :)

**Thoughts:** Worked for 3 hours until XCode crashes. Good thing I used a timer this time.

### Day 3: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished signup and login view controllers. Learned how to call the camera and photo library. Also learned a little bit about gestures but can't really implement it in the app, maybe later? Also, created some graphics for the zodiac signs and learned how to use UIDatePicker.

**Thoughts:** Worked for more than 6 hours (stopped counting after 4 hours) since it's the weekend :)

### Day 4: October 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the settings page, which took me awhile to finish. I was able to make a function to crop the profile photo. Learned to use PFGeopoint to determin location. Also, removed any kind of error that may take place while signing up and logging in. Tomorrow I have to figure out how to fix the UIActivityIndicatorView while saving user info AND start with showing the matches. 

**Thoughts:** Worked again for more than 6 hours but there is a significant progress today :)

### Day 5: October 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Populated user list for more than 2 hours. Finished the main view controller with the compatibility calculator :)

**Thoughts:** Another significant progress today despite the distractions (ahem, netflix).

### Day 6: October 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Was able to somehow fix the UIView in the main controller after the gestures end. Also struggled a bit on creating  a text messenger within the app. 

**Thoughts:** Little progress today because I was distracted by depression.

### Day 7: October 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Done with the first view controller of the messaging part of this app. Only one more part left to code, which is the messenger and then I can polish the design and also add ads.

**Thoughts:** Once again, little progress because of distractions but little by little I'll get there.

### Day 8: October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Messaging part of the app is working but not perfect! It looks weird but it already looks like a messenger anyway lol

**Thoughts:** I have to be extra patient with myself and think of a solution.

### Day 9: October 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Was able to fix the messaging part, both users' messages appear now (after getting an answer from stackoverflow) but not in chronological order TT. Thought of creating another feature instead of messenger. 

**Thoughts:** I don't think I'm better than yesterday. I really have to pick up my pace so I can work on many other projects.

### Day 10: October 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still couldn't make the messenger to work fine. Looked for frameworks to use instead but also struggled to implement them :(

**Thoughts:** Once again, no progress today but it's ok, I shouldn't get discouraged.

### Day 11: October 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to learn and understand Chatto, the framework I chose to build a messenger within my app. For some reason, my app crashes at some point where it usually works. So yeah, I guess I have to run through the code once again. 

**Thoughts:** At this point, I have to be patient with myself and always remember that this is part of the learning curve.

### Day 12: October 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started everything from scratch again but this time with better design and interaction in mind (a friend told me it's not attractive lol also because the app crashes a lot. Searched and installed several frameworks, hoping they will save me a lot of time as well as learn more about Swift. 

**Thoughts:** As much as I hate myself for dragging this project longer than I intended to, I proved that I am very patient though.

### Day 13: October 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to scrape a website without any video tutorials and limited resources! Even though I wasn't able to make it work as I originally planned, it still loks good on my app (I can make improvements later on). 

**Thoughts:** New learnings today so I'm satisfied :)

### Day 14: October 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried to integrate Koloda into my app to create that tinder-swipe effect. Also finished the first unit of python course from rmotr.com.

**Thoughts:** Learned new stuff today too until my laptop died.

### Day 15: October 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still having problems fetching data from parse to show on my app.

**Thoughts:** Patience...patience...patience...I'll be able to complete this for sure!

### Day 16: October 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Done with the swiping view (only have to work on the matching logic thing). Almost done with the messaging part! 

**Thoughts:** Very happy with the significant progress I made today. I just have to keep my focus on this project to get it done soon!

### Day 17: October 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just little progress with layout and graphics. Couldn't figure out how to load and retieve messages from Parse backend.

**Thoughts:** A little bit frustrated today.

### Day 18: October 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tried Firebase for the messaging backend.

**Thoughts:** A little bit overwhelmed with new stuff to learn but still it's fun.

### Day 19: October 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally able to fetch data from Firebase!
